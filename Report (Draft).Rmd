## Introduction

This project is a tutorial of using multivaraite time series analysis for the 
stock market index, NIFTY 50 from NSE (National Stock Exchange) India. The 
data is obtained from 
[Nifty 50](https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/nifty50-stock-market-data) 
contains price history and trading volumes of fifty stocks in India from 
2000-01-03 to 2020-09-30. 

We illustrates how to using Python, R, and Stata to apply Auto Regressive 
Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) to time series data. ARIMA is able to fit 
a given non-seasonal non-stationary time series based on its lag values.
A general ARIMA model consists of three parts: the "AR" part means the variable
of interest is regressed on its lag terms, the "I" part means the differenced
values are used, and the "MA" part means the regression error is modelled as a
linear combination of error terms in the past. The purpose of using differenced
terms is to make the time series stationary for autoregression.

A general ARIMA model consists of three parts: the "AR" part means the variable
of interest is regressed on its lag terms, the "I" part means the differenced
values are used, and the "MA" part means the regression error is modelled as a
linear combination of error terms in the past. The purpose of using differenced
terms is to make the time series stationary for autoregression.

An ARIMA model is characterized by 3 terms: p (the order of AR term), q 
(the order of the MA term), and d (number of differencing to make time series 
stationary). Given a time series \(\{X_t\}\), an \(ARIMA(p, d, q)\) model 
can be expressed as: 
$$(1-\sum_{i=1}^p\phi_iL^i)(1-L)^dX_t=
(1+\sum_{i=1}^q\theta_iL^i)\epsilon_t + \delta$$
where \(\epsilon_t\) is the error term, \(L\) is the lag operator, i.e.
\(LX_t = X_{t-1}, \forall t>1\), \(p\) is the number of lagged terms of \(X\),
\(d\) is the number of times of differencing needed for stationarity,
\(q\) is the number of lagged forecast errors in prediction, \(\delta\)
is the interception term for the regression, and \(\theta, \phi\)'s are 
the estimated regression coefficients.

ARIMA models are fitted in order to understand the data better and forecast
future data. They are based on linear regression models. The best model can
be chosen using AIC or BIC.

## Data Description

`NIFTY 50` data consist of 50 stocks, 230104 observations on 15 variables. 
The data contains daily open, close, highest and lowest prices, volume and 
other relevant information for the "Nifty Fifty" stocks since January 2000. 
Detailed variable descriptions are shown in Table 1 below.

```{r description, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# variable description
var_names = names(nifty)
var_names[16] = "Return"
tab1 = data.frame(name = var_names, 
                  description = 
                    c("Date of trade", "Name of the company",
                      "We have only one series: Equity(EQ)",
                     "Previous day's close price", "Open price of day",
                     "Highest price in day", "Lowest price in day",
                     "Last traded price in day", "Close price of day",
                     "Volume Weighted Average Price",
                     "A measure of sellers versus buyers of a particular stock", 
                     "The number of shares available for sale",
                     "The number of shares traded", 
                  "Shares which are actually transferred among demat accounts",
                  "Percent of deliverble volume",
                  "Return of trade"))
```

<details>
<summary> **Click to see variable descriptions.** </summary>
```{r var_tab, echo = FALSE}
tab.cap1 = '**Table 1**. *Varaibel descriptions of NIFTY 50 data*'
col_names = c("Variable Name", "Variable Description")
tab1 %>%
  knitr::kable(format = 'html',  col.names = col_names, caption = tab.cap1) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling('striped', full_width = TRUE) %>% 
  kableExtra::column_spec(1, italic = T) 
```
</details>

As we are more interested in the stock prices, we use the variable
<code>VWAP</code> for the most part. It can summarize the average price of the
stock on a trading day. We want to catch the trend of stock prices across the
years and possibly forecast future stock prices.

```{r clean_data, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
old_sym = c('MUNDRAPORT', 'UTIBANK', 'BAJAUTOFIN', 'BHARTI', 'HEROHONDA',
       'HINDALC0', 'HINDLEVER', 'INFOSYSTCH', 'JSWSTL', 'KOTAKMAH', 'TELCO',
       'TISCO', 'UNIPHOS', 'SESAGOA', 'SSLT', 'ZEETELE')
new_sym = c('ADANIPORTS', 'AXISBANK', 'BAJFINANCE', 'BHARTIARTL', 'HEROMOTOCO',
       'HINDALCO', 'HINDUNILVR', 'INFY', 'JSWSTEEL', 'KOTAKBANK', 'TATAMOTORS',
       'TATASTEEL', 'UPL', 'VEDL', 'VEDL', 'ZEEL')
# summary statistics of variable of interest
nifty = nifty %>%
  mutate(Symbol = lapply(Symbol, 
                         function(x) replace(x, x %in% old_sym, new_sym)),
         Trades = ifelse(is.na(Trades), 0, Trades),
         Return = Close - `Prev Close`) %>% 
  select(Date, Symbol, Return, VWAP, Volume, Trades)
summary(nifty[, -2])
```

```{r trend, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = fig.cap1, fig.width = 6.8}
# plot trend of all stocks
fig.cap1 = "**Figure 1.** *Daily trend of all stocks, 2000-2020.*"
nifty_ts = reshape2::melt(nifty[, -c(2)], id.vars = "Date")
ggplot(nifty_ts, aes(x = Date, y = value)) + 
    geom_line(color="lightblue") + 
    theme_bw() +
    facet_wrap(~ variable, scales = "free_y", ncol = 1)
```

From the trend of all stocks, we can see the time series exhibit 
non-stationarity. There was a substantial strike to the India stock market 
after the outbreak of Coronavirus.

## Core Example {.tabset .tabset-pills}

### Python

#### Data cleaning and visualization

Firstly, we import the data.

```{python import}
import sys
sys.path.append('/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages')
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
df = pd.read_csv('./NIFTY50_all.csv')
```

The variable <code>Trades</code> has too many missing values, we can delete it.
We can delete redundant variables and impute <code>\%Deliverable</code> via
Simple Imputation because the are not so many missing values. We also need to
merge different symbols for the same stock.

```{python cleaning}
from datetime import datetime
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
# Drop redundant variables and variables with too many missing values
df['Date'] = [datetime.strptime(x, '%Y-%m-%d') for x in df['Date']]
df1 = df.drop(['Trades', 'Deliverable Volume', 'Series'], axis=1)
ls1 = ['MUNDRAPORT', 'UTIBANK', 'BAJAUTOFIN', 'BHARTI', 'HEROHONDA',
       'HINDALC0', 'HINDLEVER', 'INFOSYSTCH', 'JSWSTL', 'KOTAKMAH', 'TELCO',
       'TISCO', 'UNIPHOS', 'SESAGOA', 'SSLT', 'ZEETELE']
ls2 = ['ADANIPORTS', 'AXISBANK', 'BAJFINANCE', 'BHARTIARTL', 'HEROMOTOCO',
       'HINDALCO', 'HINDUNILVR', 'INFY', 'JSWSTEEL', 'KOTAKBANK', 'TATAMOTORS',
       'TATASTEEL', 'UPL', 'VEDL', 'VEDL', 'ZEEL']
df1['Symbol'] = df1['Symbol'].replace(ls1, ls2)
df1['Symbol'] = pd.Categorical(df1['Symbol'])
# Impute missing values
df2 = pd.get_dummies(data=df1, drop_first=True)
df2['Date']=df2['Date'].map(datetime.toordinal)
imp = SimpleImputer()
p = imp.fit_transform(df2)
df1['%Deliverble'] = p[:, 10]
```

We can take a look at the data. Take the stock "ADANIPORTS" as an example.

```{python visualization}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
names = df1['Symbol'].cat.categories
example = df1[df1['Symbol'] == names[0]]
fig, ax = plt.subplots(3, 1, figsize=(8, 8))
ax[0].plot(example['Date'], example['VWAP'])
ax[0].set_xticks([])
ax[0].set_xlabel('Days')
ax[0].set_ylabel('Volume weighted average price')
ax[1].plot(example['Date'], example['Volume'])
ax[1].set_xticks([])
ax[1].set_xlabel('Days')
ax[1].set_ylabel('Volume')
ax[2].plot(example['Date'], example['Turnover'])
ax[2].set_xticks([])
ax[2].set_xlabel('Days')
ax[2].set_ylabel('Turnover')
ax[0].set_title('Time series plots of stock %s' % names[0])
```

#### Determine model parameters

We will use the time series VWAP for the analysis below.

The differencing parameter \(d\) of the model can be determined by doing
Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests, which can indicate whether the time series
are stationary. 

```{python determine_d}
from statsmodels.tsa.arima_model import ARIMA
from pmdarima.arima.utils import ndiffs
# This function chooses the smallest d for the series to be stationary
names = df1['Symbol'].cat.categories
ls0 = []
for i in names:
    subdf = df1[df1['Symbol'] == i]
    # Select the rows for stock i
    ls0.append(ndiffs(subdf['VWAP'], test='adf'))
ls0  # Most values are 1
max(ls0) # We don't need 2-order differencing
```

In order to ensure all time series are stationary, we choose \(d=1\) for all
stocks.

The AR parameter \(p\) of the model can be determined by looking at Partial
Autocorrelation plots. These plots indicate the correlation between the series
and its lag. We use the first 4 stocks alphabetically as a sample. Notice the
series need to be differenced first (\(d=1\)).

```{python determine_p}
from statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots import plot_acf, plot_pacf
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 4, figsize=(15, 5))
# Take the first 4 stocks as a sample
for i in range(4):
    subdf = df1[df1['Symbol'] == names[i]]
    # Select the rows for stock number i
    plot_pacf(subdf['VWAP'].diff().dropna(), ax=ax[i])
    ax[i].set_title('PACF plot for stock %s' % names[i])
```

Notice lag 1 is at least borderline significant in the plots for all stocks,
but lag 2 is not significant. Therefore, we can choose \(p=1\) for all stocks.

The MA parameter \(q\) of the model can be determined by looking at
Autocorrelation (ACF) plots. We use the next 4 stocks alphabetically as a 
sample. Similarly, the series need to be differenced (\(d=1\)).

```{python determine_q}
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 4, figsize=(15, 5))
for i in range(4):
    subdf = df1[df1['Symbol'] == names[i+4]]
    plot_acf(subdf['VWAP'].diff().dropna(), ax=ax[i])
    ax[i].set_title('ACF plot for stock %s' % names[i+4])
```

Notice lag 1 is significant for most of the stocks but lag 2 is not. Therefore
we can choose \(q=1\) for the MA term.

#### Fit models

According to the process above, we choose the \(ARIMA(1, 1, 1)\) for all
stocks. After fitting the models, we can view some of the summaries. Take the
first 5 stocks alphabetically as an example.

```{python fitmodels111}
mlist = [] # Models
flist = [] # Model fits
for i in names:
    subdf = df1[df1['Symbol'] == i]
    m = ARIMA(list(subdf['VWAP']), order=(1, 1, 1))
    mlist.append(m)
    flist.append(m.fit(disp=0))
for i in range(5):
    print(flist[i].summary())
```

Notice that for the first 3 stocks, the model fit is not good. We can consider
removing the MA term since it's non-significant for some stocks, i.e. choosing
the \(ARIMA(1, 1, 0)\) model.

```{python fitmodels110}
mlist0 = [] # Models
flist0 = [] # Model fits
for i in names:
    subdf = df1[df1['Symbol'] == i]
    m = ARIMA(list(subdf['VWAP']), order=(1, 1, 0))
    mlist0.append(m)
    flist0.append(m.fit(disp=0))
```

We use AIC has the model choosing criteria. The AIC decreases for the first
three stocks, and increases for the 4th and 5th, indicating different stocks
need different models.

```{python choose_model}
includema = [] # Whether MA term should be included
for i in range(50):
    includema.append(flist0[i].aic > flist[i].aic)
pd.value_counts(includema)
```

#### Model diagnostics

Firstly, we can use the in-sample lagged values to predict the time series.

```{python in_sample_pred}
fig, ax = plt.subplots(10, 5, figsize=(15, 20))
for i in range(50):
    if(includema): # ARIMA(1,1,1)
        flist[i].plot_predict(dynamic=False, ax=ax[i // 5, i % 5])
    else: # ARIMA(1,1,0)
        flist0[i].plot_predict(dynamic=False, ax=ax[i // 5, i % 5])
    ax[i // 5, i % 5].set_title(names[i])
fig.tight_layout()
fig
```

We can also forecast future VWAPs using the chosen models. For example, we
can forecast the average prices in the next 200 trading days after the time
series.

```{python forecast, echo = T, results = 'hide'}
fig, ax = plt.subplots(10, 5, figsize=(15, 20))
for i in range(50):
    if(includema):
        forecast, b, ci = flist[i].forecast(200, alpha=0.05)
    else:
        forecast, b, ci = flist0[i].forecast(200, alpha=0.05)
    subdf = df1[df1['Symbol'] == names[i]]
    ax[i // 5, i % 5].plot(list(subdf['VWAP']))
    idx = range(len(subdf['VWAP']), 200+len(subdf['VWAP']))
    ax[i // 5, i % 5].plot(idx, forecast)
    ax[i // 5, i % 5].fill_between(idx, ci[:, 0], ci[:, 1], 
                 alpha=0.15)
    ax[i // 5, i % 5].set_title(names[i])
    ax[i // 5, i % 5].set_xticks([])
fig.tight_layout()
```
```{python forecast_results}
fig
```

Notice the confidence intervals are very wide, indicating it's not easy to
forecast stock prices.

#### Model improvement

Now that we chose different models for different stocks, we can further
improve the models by choosing the most proper model for each stock.

We can use <code>auto_arima</code> to choose models. It compares different
models and chooses the best one. Again, we use ADF test to determine \(d\),
and AIC to determine \(p,q\). Take "ADANIPORTS", "ASIANPAINT" and "BPCL" as
examples.

```{python improvements}
import pmdarima as paim
subdf = df1[df1['Symbol'] == names[0]]
m1 = paim.auto_arima(subdf['VWAP'], start_p=1, start_q=1, test='adf',
                     max_p=3, max_q=3)
m1.summary() # The chosen model was ARIMA(1, 0, 1), which is a good fit.
ls0[0] # Indeed, differencing is not needed for the stock 'ADANIPORTS'.
subdf = df1[df1['Symbol'] == names[1]]
m2 = paim.auto_arima(subdf['VWAP'], start_p=1, start_q=1, test='adf',
                     max_p=3, max_q=3)
m2.summary() # The chosen model was ARIMA(0, 1, 0), which is a good fit.
# For 'ASIANPAINT', the 1-order difference series is close to a constant.
subdf = df1[df1['Symbol'] == names[7]]
m3 = paim.auto_arima(subdf['VWAP'], start_p=1, start_q=1, test='adf',
                     max_p=3, max_q=3, error_action='ignore')
m3.summary() # The chosen model was ARIMA(1, 1, 2), which is a good fit.
# For 'BPCL' second order MA term is needed.
```

We can improve each of the models invidivually for slightly better
forecast performance.

### R

#### Autocorrelation Plots

We will focus on the variables: `Symbol`, `VWAP`, `Volume`, `Trades` and a 
newly created variable `Return`, which is the difference between `Close` and 
`Prev Close`. First we choose one stock to analyze its autocorrelation of 
trend on theabove four variables. The trend plot above shows large value of 
`Volume`, sowe can take log to decrease its trend.

```{r acf, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.cap = fig.cap2}
library(forecast)
candidate = "ADANIPORTS"
nifty_cand = nifty %>% filter(Symbol == candidate) %>% 
  mutate(Volume = log(Volume))
vars_list = names(nifty_cand)[-c(1, 2)]
fig.cap2 = "**Figure 2.** *ACF plots of stock: ADANIPORTS.*"
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
for ( var in vars_list ) {
  df_ts = ts(nifty_cand[[var]], frequency = 1, start = c(2000, 01, 03))
  # acf
  acf_tou <- acf(df_ts, lag.max = 30, plot = FALSE)
  plot(acf_tou, xlab = "Lag (in Year)", main = var)
}
```

Notice that all the variables show high autocorrelation except for `Return`, 
which is because `Return` is calculated from the first difference of closing 
price working as a linear filter applied to eliminate a trend. Since we are 
going to apply ARIMA model to the data, which can works for non-stationary 
time series, we can leave the model to detrend time seires. For the 
illustration purpose, we will take first difference of other three variables 
and compare the autocorrelation plot to the previous one.

```{r plotacf, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
acf_diff_plot = function(df = nifty, sym = "ADANIPORTS") {
  stopifnot( length(sym) == 1)
  stopifnot( sym %in% df$Symbol)
  
  df = df %>% filter(Symbol == sym) %>% 
    mutate(Volume = log(Volume))
  vars_list = names(df)[-c(1, 2)]
  par(mfrow=c(2,2))
  for ( var in vars_list ) {
    if (var != "Return"){
    df_ts = ts(df[[var]], frequency = 1, start = c(2000, 01, 03))
    df_ts = diff(df_ts, 1)
    } else {
    df_ts = ts(df[[var]], frequency = 1, start = c(2000, 01, 03))
    }
    # acf
    acf_tou <- acf(df_ts, lag.max = 30, plot = FALSE)
    plot(acf_tou, xlab = "Lag (in Year)", main = var)
  }
} 
```

```{r acf2, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap = fig.cap3}
fig.cap3 = "**Figure 3.** *ACF plots of first difference of time seires.*"
acf_diff_plot(df = nifty, sym = candidate)
```

#### Fitting an ARIMA Model

 We can choose the ARIMA Model by AIC. Let’s tabulate some AIC values for 
 a range of different choices of p and q, assuming d takes 0 for `Return` 
 while 1 for other 3 variables. Below shows the AIC table of fitting ARIMA 
 on `Return` time series of stock: "ADANIPORTS". We will subset the last 120 
 time series as test data.
 
```{r aic, echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE,message = FALSE}
aic_table <- function(ts, P, Q, d){ 
  table <- matrix(NA, (P + 1), (Q + 1)) 
  for(p in 0:P) { 
    for(q in 0:Q) { 
      table[p + 1, q + 1] <- arima(ts, order=c(p, d, q))$aic
    } 
  }
  dimnames(table) <- list(paste("AR", 0:P, sep = ""), 
                          paste("MA", 0:Q, sep = ""))
  table
}
# Construct AIC table
nifty_cand_ts = ts(nifty_cand[, -2]$Return, 
                   frequency = 1, start = c(2000, 01, 03))
nifty_aic_table <- aic_table(head(nifty_cand_ts, -30), 4, 4, 0) 
tab.cap2 = '**Table 2**. *AIC for different ARIMA parameters*'
nifty_aic_table %>%
  knitr::kable(format = 'html', caption = tab.cap2) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling('striped', full_width = TRUE) 
```

The AIC table suggests that ARIMA(4, 0, 4) is the best model for the return of 
"ADANIPORTS". This model may give a sign that increasing p and q will tend to 
get smaller AIC for a better fit. However, models with higher p and q are 
more complex, so it may lead to problems like overfitting, numerical stability 
and etc. We usually prefer a simply model, which also better for interpretation.

Even though it is nice to view the change of AIC value as the change of 
p and q, for a big dataset like this, it is very inefficient to iterate over 
range of p and q. `auto.arima()`in the `forest` package is much faster in 
generating the results. We can verify that `auto.arima()` also suggests 
ARIMA(4, 0, 0) is the model with the best fit in the range of (1, 4) of p and q.

```{r tsarima, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ts_arima <- auto.arima(head(nifty_cand_ts, -30), max.p = 4, 
                      max.q = 4, max.d = 3)
print(ts_arima)
```

#### Forecasting using an ARIMA Model

Lastly, we will forecast the next 120 time series and compare the result with 
our test set.
```{r acc, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ts_forecasts <- forecast(ts_arima, h = 30) 
acc <- accuracy(ts_forecasts, head(tail(nifty_cand_ts, 30), 7))
print(round(acc, 4))
```
The RMSE and MAE for the test set are 5.5276 and 4.5046, respectively.

```{r forc_fig, warning=FALSE, fig.cap = fig.cap4, fig.height=4, fig.width=6.8}
fig.cap4 = "**Figure 4.** *Forecasts from ARIMA(4, 0, 4) with zero mean.*"
autoplot(ts_forecasts, main = "") + xlab("Day") + 
  ylab("Return") +
  theme_bw()
```

### Stata

#### Data cleaning and visualization

Firstly, we import the data and do data cleanning. We drop the variable 
<code>\Trades</code> and <code>\%Deliverable</code>. Also, we transform the
<code>\Date</code> variable from string type to date type to treat the whole
data set as time series data set.

```{stata import_cleanning_stata, results = "hide", eval=FALSE}
import delimited NIFTY50_all.csv, clear

* Data Cleaning
gen date2 = date(date, "YMD")
format date2 %tdCCYY-nn-dd
drop date series
drop trades deliverablevolume
rename date2 date
label variable date "Date"

* Replace Symbol Names
replace symbol = "ADANIPORTS" if symbol == "MUNDRAPORT"
replace symbol = "AXISBANK" if symbol == "UTIBANK"
replace symbol = "BAJFINANCE" if symbol == "BAJAUTOFIN"
replace symbol = "BHARTIARTL" if symbol == "BHARTI"
replace symbol = "HEROMOTOCO" if symbol == "HEROHONDA"
replace symbol = "HINDALCO" if symbol == "HINDALC0"
replace symbol = "HINDUNILVR" if symbol == "HINDLEVER"
replace symbol = "INFY" if symbol == "INFOSYSTCH"
replace symbol = "JSWSTEEL" if symbol == "JSWSTL"
replace symbol = "KOTAKBANK" if symbol == "KOTAKMAH"
replace symbol = "TATAMOTORS" if symbol == "TELCO"
replace symbol = "TATASTEEL" if symbol == "TISCO"
replace symbol = "UPL" if symbol == "UNIPHOS"
replace symbol = "VEDL" if symbol == "SESAGOA"
replace symbol = "VEDL" if symbol == "SSLT"
replace symbol = "ZEEL" if symbol == "ZEETELE"

* Save the cleaned data
save NIFTY_clean, replace 
```

Then we visualize the data and the stock "ADANIPORTS" is taken as an example.

#### Determine model parameters

We will use the time series VWAP for the analysis below.

For all stocks, we do Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests to determine whether the
time series are stationary or not.

```{stata ADFtest_stata, eval=FALSE}
use NIFTY_clean, clear

foreach sym of local sbls {
	use NIFTY_clean, clear
	keep if symbol == "`sym'"
	tsset date
	dfuller d1.vwap
}
```

We do the test on the <code>\vwap</code> with the first-order differentiation.
All stocks are reporting minimum p-values, hence we decide to use \(d=1\) for 
all stocks.

Then, in order to find AR parameter \(p\) of the model, we generate the partial 
autoregressive (PACF) plots together with autoregressive (ACF) plots.

Note: we will only plot the first 8 stocks as an example.

```{stata pacf_acf, results = "hide", eval=FALSE}
use NIFTY_clean, clear

levelsof(symbol), local(sbls)

local sbls_f8 = "ADANIPORTS ASIANPAINT AXISBANK BAJAJ-AUTO BAJAJFINSV ///
  BAJFINANCE BHARTIARTL BPCL"

foreach sym of local sbls_f8 {
	use NIFTY_clean, clear
	keep if symbol == "`sym'"
	tsset date
	ac D.vwap
	graph export acf_`sym'.png
	pac D.vwap
	graph export pacf_`sym'.png
}
```

The PACF plots for the first 4 stocks are the following:
![pacf_ADA](./Stata/acf&pacf/pacf_ADANIPORTS.png)
![pacf_ASI](./Stata/acf&pacf/pacf_ASIANPAINT.png)
![pacf_AXI](./Stata/acf&pacf/pacf_AXISBANK.png)
![pacf_BAJ_A](./Stata/acf&pacf/pacf_BAJAJ-AUTO.png)

And the ACF plots for the next 4 stocks are the following:

![acf_BAJ_F](./Stata/acf&pacf/acf_BAJAJFINSV.png)
![acf_BAJF](./Stata/acf&pacf/acf_BAJFINANCE.png)
![acf_BHA](./Stata/acf&pacf/acf_BHARTIARTL.png)
![acf_BPC](./Stata/acf&pacf/acf_BPCL.png)


We can get the similar conclusion that lag 1 is absolutely significant while lag
2 is not, hencewe can choose \(p=1\) for the AR term and \(q=1\) for the MA 
term for all stocks.

#### Fit models

According to the process above, we choose the \(ARIMA(1, 1, 1)\) for all
stocks. However, diagnostics tells sometimes the \(ARIMA(1, 1, 0)\) performs
better for some stocks. Hence, we try to use the better model to fit the data 
and then plot the predicted values against original values.

Note: we will only plot the first 5 stocks as an example.

```{stata fitting, results = "hide", eval=FALSE}
use NIFTY_clean, clear

local sbls_f5 = "ADANIPORTS ASIANPAINT AXISBANK BAJAJ-AUTO BAJAJFINSV"

foreach sym of local sbls_f5 {
	use NIFTY_clean, clear
	keep if symbol == "`sym'"
	tsset date
	arima vwap, arima(1,1,1)
	estat ic
	mat l_aim = r(S)
	scalar aic_aim = l_aim[1,5]
	arima vwap, arima(1,1,0)
	estat ic
	mat l_ai = r(S)
	scalar aic_ai = l_aim[1,5]
	if aic_aim > aic_ai {
		arima vwap, arima(1,1,0)
		predict vwap_p
		gen vwap_p = vwap_pd + vwap
		graph twoway line vwap date, lwidth("vthin") color("blue")///
		  || line vwap_p date, lwidth("vthin") color("red") lpattern("dash")
		graph export fitted_`sym'.png
	} 
	else {
		arima vwap, arima(1,1,1)
		predict vwap_pd
		gen vwap_p = vwap_pd + vwap
		graph twoway line vwap date, lwidth("vthin") color("blue")///
		  || line vwap_p date, lwidth("vthin") color("red") lpattern("dash")
		graph export fitted_`sym'.png
	}
}
```

The sample fitted graphs are:

![fit_BAJ_F](./Stata/FittedPlots/fitted_BAJAJFINSV.png)

#### Model improvement

Now that we chose different models for different stocks, we can further
improve the models by choosing the most proper model for each stock.

However, Stata does not have some similar funciton as <code>auto_arima</code> 
to choose models automatically. Hence, we may related to other two languages (
Python, R). Heavy and tedious computation is expected in Stata here.

## To-do list
